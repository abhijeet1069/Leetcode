# Leetcode

## Progress

Starting with Matrix questions, till 30 problems are done

## DSA Lifecycle

### Phase 1

You know a programming language but never touched DSA or never did problem-solving in the past

Only solve Easy problems in this phase, no need to touch medium or hard problems. Do some 25-30 easy problems from 
each topic mentioned above and move on to the next topic. Sort the easy problems in order of increasing difficulty. 
This method of practicing problems is also called the BFS way of practicing.

- Arrays (32 easy, 16 medium, 2 hard)
- Strings (31 easy, 6 medium)
- Matrix (1 medium)

- Maths
- Stack
- Queue
- Recursion
- Searching and Sorting
- Linked List
- Binary Trees and Binary Search Trees
- Asymptotic analysis (Big-O notation)

### Phase 2

You know basic data structures and have done some ~200-250 problems on leetcode from different topics and different 
difficulty levels but not started with advanced data structures

Practising more and more medium problems instead of practicing easy problems. 

Remember the below learning ratio that you will be getting from solving Easy, Medium, and Hard problems, so choose 
wisely.
    Approximately, Learning from 100 Easy Problems = Learning from 50 Medium problems = Learning from 25 Hard problems, 
if picked wisely from the pool of problems we have on leetcode.

- Medium hard problems on topics mentioned in phase-1 
- Bit Manipulation and Bitmask 
- Two pointers 
- Sliding window 
- Hashing and Hash table 
- Divide and Conquer 
- Number theory 
- Monotonic stack 
- Advanced recursion and Backtracking (Standard problems)
- Greedy Algorithms (Standard problems)
- Simulation and observation-based problems 
- Dynamic programming (Standard problems)
- Graph (Standard problems)

### Phase 3

You know basic and advanced data structures but you still struggling to perform better on leetcode contests especially 
with the hard problems, in other words, you are not feeling confident in DSA

Focus on advanced topics like DP, Graph, Rolling hash, String matching, etc.

### Phase 4

You are not struggling with any topics, you have already mastered the art of problem-solving by brute practice, effort, 
and hard work.
Leetcoders in this phase either get their dream job or keep attending contests for fun. They don't do brute practice 
anymore. Reaching this state is no joke, and leetcoders who have made it this far are a true gem.
