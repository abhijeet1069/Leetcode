/**
 * You are given row x col grid representing a map where grid[i][j] = 1 represents land and grid[i][j] = 0 represents
 * water.
 *
 * Grid cells are connected horizontally/vertically (not diagonally). The grid is completely surrounded by water,
 * and there is exactly one island (i.e., one or more connected land cells).
 *
 * The island doesn't have "lakes", meaning the water inside isn't connected to the water around the island.
 * One cell is a square with side length 1. The grid is rectangular, width and height don't exceed 100. Determine the
 * perimeter of the island.
