/**
 * You are given an image represented by an m x n grid of integers image, where image[i][j] represents the pixel value
 * of the image. You are also given three integers sr, sc, and color. Your task is to perform a flood fill on the image starting from the pixel image[sr][sc].
 *
 * To perform a flood fill:
 *
 * Begin with the starting pixel and change its color to color.
 * Perform the same process for each pixel that is directly adjacent (pixels that share a side with the original pixel,
 * either horizontally or vertically) and shares the same color as the starting pixel.
 * Keep repeating this process by checking neighboring pixels of the updated pixels and modifying their color if it
 * matches the original color of the starting pixel.
 * The process stops when there are no more adjacent pixels of the original color to update.
 * Return the modified image after performing the flood fill.
 *
 * Example 1:
 *
 * Input: image = [[1,1,1],[1,1,0],[1,0,1]], sr = 1, sc = 1, color = 2
 *
 * Output: [[2,2,2],[2,2,0],[2,0,1]]
